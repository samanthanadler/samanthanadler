Hi! I'm Sam **(she/her)**, a student at Hofstra University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and planning to graduate in May 2027.
-

I'm interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science and would like to work in one of these three disciplines. I will begin a year-long paid fellowship in May with Break Through Tech, a non-profit started at Cornell to give female and non-binary students appropriate skills for technology-based careers.

I've taken courses in Python, C++, discrete mathematics, and calculus. In the fall I plan on taking courses in Java and statistics. Outside of my major, I'm a member of the Honors College, participating in lectures and discussions based around a similar theme for the entirety of the semester. This semester the honors program uses a food studies curriculum; next semester's honors program focuses on an ancient topic to be decided.

Outside of the classroom, I'm the Public Relations chair of Hofstra's C.O.D.E. (Coding Opportunities, Development, and Exploration), a tutor in Hofstra's Math Tutoring Center, a member of Hofstra's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers, the Hofstra Math Club, and the newly reinstated chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery. However, my interests and involvements go beyond computing and mathematics. I play the tenor saxophone in Hofstra's Pep Band and write sports stories for the university newspaper.
