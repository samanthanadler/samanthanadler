# 👋🏻 Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler (she/her)!
### 👩🏻‍💻 Junior at Hofstra University studying Computer Science and Mathematics <br> ⚾ Aspiring Data Scientist and Sports Analytics Enthusiast
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will share some awesome projects in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

I've been interested in data science since my senior year of high school, after I declared a "double major" in computer science and mathematics (it's really a singular academic program that behaves like a double major). I'm always teaching myself new skills in data science to build on my foundational knowledge from the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), which I am participating in during the 2024-2025 school year. I'd love to work in sports analytics and use my data science skills on one of my favorite teams!

I hope you enjoy my projects and consider putting me on your data science or machine learning radar!

## 🛠️ Skill Set
- <b>Programming Languages:</b> Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, R, SQL, HTML/CSS, LaTeX
- <b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Linux, RStudio, Microsoft Office, Power BI

## What I'm Currently Working On
### 🧢 [Analyzing Player Performance of MLB Silver Slugger Award Finalists](https://github.com/samanthanadler/batting-trends-in-silver-sluggers)
This project uses 2024 MLB batting data compiled from MLB's Statcast technology to analyze common trends in batting behavior between the 2024 Silver Slugger Award winners.

The Silver Slugger Award is awarded to twenty MLB players annually, with the first awards being issued in 1980 and voted on by MLB coaching staff members unable to vote for representatives for their own team. While most voters consider batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage as the most important metrics to determine each winner, the pitcher’s behavior towards each batter’s at-bats could play a part in determining newer metrics for a player’s offensive performance. This project determines if Silver Slugger winners tended to have "easier" at-bats compared to skew their offensive performance and considers factors including initial and final pitch locations.

## Other Projects

### 🚗 [Predicting Auto Claims Severity](https://github.com/Allstate1A-BTT/Allstate1A-Studio-Project) (with Allstate)
This project uses insurance claim data. The main goal is to predict the claim's final cost.

It can take months to know the final cost to insurance companies like Allstate from a claim. This is due to the time involved for repair shops to repair the vehicle, third-party claims where who is at fault needs to be determined, and injuries which may involve doctor visits over a long period of time. If we can estimate the cost up front when the claim is first filed, this can be used to help set reserves and gain a better understanding of what contributes to higher claims and vice versa.

### 🥽 [Understanding VR Usage in Various Fields of Education](https://github.com/samanthanadler/vr-usage-in-education)
This project analyzes the impact of virtual reality on the improvement of education while taking special interest in the students’ field of study.

Virtual reality in the classroom can provide students with hands-on experience through simulations relevant to their field of study, regardless of their chosen discipline. Medical schools and facilities offer virtual reality training to understand the human body and practice surgical techniques not on human subjects. Engineering and architecture students can view their designs and analyze their functionality and aesthetics in a virtual environment, not needing to use physical material to test their ideas. Art students can use virtual reality to create 3D models and draw and paint in 3D.
