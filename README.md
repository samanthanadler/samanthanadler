Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler!
I’m a student at Hofstra University and an aspiring data scientist!

I am in incoming sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics, a major so small some faculty at my school hadn’t even heard of it. I’ve been interested in working with computers since elementary school, when I was introduced to the Scratch programming language and robotics. I also always had a love for numbers and took advanced math classes since middle school. When it came time to apply for schools, I didn’t know which of my favorite subjects I wanted to major in, so I chose both. My program is among the most academically challenging in the entire university, but I get to brag about being one of 20 students in it.

The main language I code in is Python because of how versatile and user-friendly it is, as well as its capabilities for machine learning and data science, the disciplines I plan on working in when I graduate. I’m participating in a year-long paid fellowship with Break Through Tech, a non-profit that gives underrepresented individuals in tech a head start when applying for AI-related careers. I’m the Public Relations Manager for my school’s new computer science club and help plan exciting club-sponsored events including hackathons, and I’m also an active member of Hofstra’s math club and chapter of the Society of Women Engineers.

While I have always been fascinated by STEM and computing, my hobbies and interests expand well beyond. I’m a creative thinker and love making art, whether it’s a painting, a bit of graphic design, or a musical piece. Not only do I play multiple instruments (clarinet, sax, piano, etc.), I have also written pieces for school bands. Upon graduation, I even joined Hofstra’s pep band and attend almost every basketball game.

Speaking of pep band, I am also an avid New York sports fan. I root for the Mets, Knicks, and Giants, as well as both Hofstra and St. John’s basketball programs. I’ve gotten into sports journalism and am an active writer for the Hofstra Chronicle’s sports section. I applied to be, and became, the Chronicle’s baseball beat reporter. Maybe I’ll run some baseball analytics with my coding and sports knowledge to enhance my reporting (I’d love to work in analytics for a sports team upon graduation).
