## Featured Project
### 🚗 Predicting Auto Claims Severity (with Allstate)
This project uses insurance claim data. The main goal is to predict the claim's final cost.

It can take months to know the final cost to insurance companies like Allstate from a claim. This is due to the time involved for repair shops to repair the vehicle, third-party claims where who is at fault needs to be determined, and injuries which may involve doctor visits over a long period of time. If we can estimate the cost up front when the claim is first filed, this can be used to help set reserves and gain a better understanding of what contributes to higher claims and vice versa.

## Other Projects

### 🥽 Understanding VR Usage in Various Fields of Education
This project analyzes the impact of virtual reality on the improvement of education while taking special interest in the students’ field of study.

Virtual reality in the classroom can provide students with hands-on experience through simulations relevant to their field of study, regardless of their chosen discipline. Medical schools and facilities offer virtual reality training to understand the human body and practice surgical techniques not on human subjects. Engineering and architecture students can view their designs and analyze their functionality and aesthetics in a virtual environment, not needing to use physical material to test their ideas. Art students can use virtual reality to create 3D models and draw and paint in 3D.
